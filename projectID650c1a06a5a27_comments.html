<HTML><BODY><p>A history of Sanskrit drama published in 1924, that was standing in my book cabinet for years. With plenty of scans online, it is now ready to go, without me scanning it.</p>
<p>I marked this book as hard, because it includes a lot of names and fragments with diacritics (mostly dots below and macrons, which can be found in the Semitic and Indic transcriptions character picker), and need to be added back by the proofers in P1 (or later if missed in the first round).</p>
<p>The letters Ç and ç are used for the Devanagari letter श, which is now commonly represented by Ś and ś (or in popular text, Sh and sh); we of course leave them as given.</p>
<p>The index of Sanskrit names is sorted in the Devanagari alphabetical order, even though it is in Latin script, so don't be surprised by that.</p>
<p>Lots of footnotes in small print to deal with.</p>
<p>Added the metrical symbols to the custom character picker; please use a dash for the metrical long symbol.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
